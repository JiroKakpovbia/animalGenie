# Purpose üìù
The Animal Genie is a game that guesses which animal the user is thinking of from a list of provided options in as few questions as possible. Initially, the user chooses an animal from a customizable gallery to think of in their head. Then, the program asks the user a series of yes or no questions to determine which animal the user has chosen. The user can set the maximum number of questions the program asks before giving up, customize the gallery‚Äôs background colour, and exit the game by pressing the power button.
